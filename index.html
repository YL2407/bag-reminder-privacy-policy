<h1>
Privacy Policy For Bag Reminder App
</h1>
<p>
This is a policy governing the interactions between Decycle Labs (us), our app "Bag Reminder", and the app's user (you).
In using our application, you indicate agreement with and understanding of all of the terms and information laid out below.

<h3>
Location Data Collection
</h3>
<p>
The only data collected by this app is location data <br>
Any data collected by this application is not stored (permanently) in any of our databases. 
The only use which this data is subjected to, necessary as part of its functioning, is that it is passed into a web-based API
(Nominatim),
from which, on the client-side, nearby supermarkets and malls are discovered. If you want to find out how your data is used
on that API, refer to the OpenStreetMap Foundation Privacy Policy <a href="https://wiki.osmfoundation.org/wiki/Privacy_Policy">here</a>.</p>

<p>
The normal, day-to-day function of this application requires access to your location in the background, as the app
must function even when it is not in the foreground so as to interfere minimally with your other activities.
Once again, the only processing this data receives is passing it through the aforementioned API.
